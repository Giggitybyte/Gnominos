Gnominos is a .Net Core 3.1 library written in Visual Basic that allows for easy interaction with the Dominos Pizza API. 

This library was inspired by the Python project [pizzapi](https://github.com/gamagori/pizzapi). Gnominos was originally supposed to be a 1:1 port of pizzapi, but after going over the code a bit I decided I didn't like the whole structure of the project. Instead, Gnominos will take the data provided by Dominos and present it in a clean way to you, the end user.
