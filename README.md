Gnominos is a .Net Core library written in Visual Basic that allows for interaction with the Dominos Pizza API. 

This library was originally supposed to be a 1:1 port of the Python wrapper [pizzapi](https://github.com/gamagori/pizzapi), but after going over the code a bit I decided I didn't like the whole structure of the project. Instead, Gnominos will take a lot of the logic from pizzapi and present it in a clean way to the end user.
